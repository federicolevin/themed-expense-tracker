# Personal Expense Tracker - Development History

**Project:** Angular Personal Expense Tracker
**Date:** July 13, 2025
**Developer:** GitHub Copilot
**Framework:** Angular (Standalone Components, Zoneless)

## 📋 Project Overview

Created a complete personal expense tracking application following Angular and TypeScript best practices. The application allows users to track their spending, categorize expenses, and view analytics through a modern, responsive interface.

## 🎯 Requirements Followed

Based on the `.instructions.md` file, the following best practices were implemented:

### TypeScript Best Practices
- ✅ Used strict type checking
- ✅ Preferred type inference when obvious
- ✅ Avoided `any` type, used proper typing throughout

### Angular Best Practices
- ✅ Used standalone components over NgModules
- ✅ Implemented signals for state management
- ✅ Used `computed()` for derived state
- ✅ Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`
- ✅ Used native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`)
- ✅ Used Reactive forms instead of Template-driven ones
- ✅ Used `inject()` function instead of constructor injection
- ✅ Avoided `ngClass` and `ngStyle`, used direct bindings
